#This file is a template for use with the test data set provided with the software package.
#Use the pound symbol (#) for comments.
#Visit the manual or paper for more information on each parameter.


#================== PATH PARAMETERS ==================

#these will be established in the bash script


#================== MAIN PARAMETERS ==================

#Aspect ratio of X- and Y-coordinates versus Z-coordinate
anisotropyZ=4

#Image background level (set conservatively)
backgroundThreshold=2

#Tau level for generating an initial set of supervoxels from the hierarchical segmentation of watershed and persistence-based clustering
persistanceSegmentationTau=1

#Sigma of gassian filter used to blur image that is subsequently used background detection and subtraction (see below options); recommend values between 10 and 30, or 10x radiusMedianFilter
sigmaGaussianBlurBackground=20

#0 or 1 to use Gaussian-blurred image for background detection (not just subtraction), so that background will be called when voxel values in the blurred image are below backgroundThreshold -- WARNING! turning this on may have aggressive background removal effects, please audition results and consider adjusting backgroundThreshold downward when this is turned on
useBlurredImageForBackgroundDetection=0

#Floating point value - weighting of blurred image prior to regional background subtraction; the blurred image is considered background and subtracted from median filtered image prior to segmentation, but is multiplied by this number first (suggest value between 0.5 and 1)
weightBlurredImageSubtract=0.25

#================ ADVANCED PARAMETERS ================
#NOTE: These parameters were not changed between the various runs presented in the associated paper.
#Most of these parameters should not be altered. However, you can modify them if required by your data.
